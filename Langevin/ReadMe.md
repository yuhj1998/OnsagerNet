This is an implementation of using OnsagerNet to learn Langevin dynamics.

1. *OnsagerNet* and other baseline ODE nets are defined in `ode_net.py`
2. `test_ode_Langevin.py` is written to generate Langevin dynamical data and learn the dyanmics using Neural ODE Nets
3. run files `paper_fig?.sh` one by one to do similar tests as in the PhyRevF paper.
