# OnsagerNet

Learning hidden low dimensional dyanmics using a Generalized Onsager Principle and neural networks

This is the original pyTorch implemenation of OnsagerNet with three applications:

1. Learning deterministic Langevin dynamics
2. Learning chaotic and non-chaotic Lorenz63 system
3. Learning a reduced model for Rayleigh Bernard Convection (RBC) based only on trajectory data.

See the ReadMe.md in each subfolder and the reference paper for more information.
